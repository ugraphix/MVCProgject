# MVCProject

It will use data entities based on Community_Assist as a model.

The project should let you view people's first name, last name and email,  but without their password hash and seed.

Modify the Detail and the edit so it only contains the fields in the select.

Also modify the create so that it uses the usp_add person stored procedure.

Add Person to the menu on the startup page. Modify the startup page to include the heading Community Assist, and a brief description of the charity.
